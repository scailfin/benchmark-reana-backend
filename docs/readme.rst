This repository contains the implementation of a workflow engine for `parameterized workflow specifications <https://github.com/scailfin/benchmark-templates>`_ that uses an existing `REANA <http://www.reanahub.io/>`_ cluster to run instances of workflow templates. This package is part of the *Reproducible Open Benchmarks for Data Analysis Platform (ROB)*.
