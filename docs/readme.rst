=====

This repository contains the implementation of a workflow controller for the `Reproducible and Reusable Data Analysis Workflow Server (flowServ) <https://github.com/scailfin/flowserv-core>`_ that uses an existing `REANA <http://www.reanahub.io/>`_ cluster to run instances of workflow templates.
